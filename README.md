# âœ¨ My personal portfolio: showcasing my work and skills.

This is my personal portfolio, a showcase of my work and skills as a software developer. It is built using Next.js, a popular React framework for building server-rendered and statically generated web applications.

The site is designed to be visually appealing and easy to navigate, with a focus on showcasing my projects and skills. It also includes a blog, where I write about my experiences and insights as a software developer.

The site is built using a variety of tools and technologies, including Tailwind CSS for styling, Next.js for server-rendering and statically generating the site, and React for building the user interface. It also uses a variety of open-source libraries and components to provide additional functionality.

I am very proud of how the site has turned out, and I hope that it will be of use to others. If you have any questions or would like to learn more about how the site was built, please don't hesitate to reach out to me.
